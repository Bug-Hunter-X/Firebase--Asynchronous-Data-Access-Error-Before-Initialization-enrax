The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a database reference before it's fully initialized.  This can happen if you're trying to read or write data too quickly after creating the database reference, or if the network connection is slow or unstable.  The error message is often non-specific, making debugging difficult. For example: `Error: [code=unavailable]` or a generic network error. This typically occurs in asynchronous operations where data access happens before a promise resolves.
