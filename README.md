# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Firebase applications: attempting to access the database before it's fully initialized. This often manifests as generic network errors or `unavailable` codes, making debugging challenging.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, which attempts to read data immediately after creating a database reference. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that utilizes promises or async/await to handle the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations correctly.  This ensures the database reference is ready before attempting any data operations.
